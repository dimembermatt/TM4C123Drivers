/**
 * @brief __aeabi_assert is called by assert when it is violated by a bad debug
 *        conditions. It takes the assert debug capture at the assert failure,
 *        turns on PF1 (the red LED) and sends debug output to UART_MODULE_0. It
 *        then loops indefinitely with interrupts turned OFF.
 * 
 * @param expr The expression that caused the assert to fail.
 * @param file The file in which the assert failed.
 * @param line The line in which the assert failed.
 * @note Users are encouraged to override the implementation of __aeabi_assert
 *       in FaultHandler.c for their programs.

/**
 * @brief HardFault_Handler is executed when either: a developer calls this
 *        function directly, typically to highlight unfinished features or when
 *        the code enters an undefined state. This function will also be called
 *        by some WEAKly defined handlers in startup.s (or
 *        tm4c123gh6pm_startup_ccs.c) if the user has not implemented strong
 *        versions of those handlers.
 *        This function implementation turns on PF1 (the red LED) on the TM4C
 *        and loops indefinitely.
 * 
 * @note Users are encouraged to override the implementation of HardFault_Handler
 *       using this function definition.
 * @note The weak implementation of HardFault_Handler, however, provides basic 
 *       debug functionality, including catching the stack trace, turning on the
 *       red indicator LED, and printing the stack trace to PC via UART.

/**
 * @brief _ReportHardFault is a function exposed to startup.s's weakly defined
 *        HardFault_Handler. It takes the stackframe at the time of faulting,
 *        turns on PF1 (the red LED), and sends debug output to UART_MODULE_0.
 *        It then loops indefinitely with interrupts turned OFF.
 * 
 * @param stackFrame Reference to registers that represent system state at time
 *                   of faulting.
 * @param _exc       Link register to the next point. Unused.
