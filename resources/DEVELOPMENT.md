# Development Instructions

## Naming Conventions

Functional modules, like ADCs or GPIOs, have methods that are prefixed with:
<ModuleName><Function>, utilizing CamelCase notation. Examples are as follows:

- GPIOInit
- SPIRead
- ST7735SetTextCursor

The only exceptions are handlers, which use an underscore to split the handler
postfix: `GPIOPortA_Handler`. This is due to backwards compatibility with older
startup.s files. This may be updated in the future, but will stay for now (Hi
code debt!).

Variable types are generally postfixed with an underscore 't', such as
`GPIOConfig_t`. These types are generally exposed outside of the module
namespace and are used in other modules. They are declared using `typedef`.
Using the above example:

```c
typedef struct GPIOConfig {
    ...
} GPIOConfig_t;
```

Other variables that are contained only in the local module namespace, such as
structs and enums, are not declared with `typedef` and do not have a postfix
underscore `t`.

Note that C doesn't actually have namespaces. In this context, a namespace is
all functions and variables specifically designed solely for a functional module.

## Design Philosophy

The current design philosophy is that the USER is responsible for managing the
state of their data, even if he or she doesn't know the specifics of it.

In developing these drivers, I have attempted to retain as much useful
information for the user in the form of a struct named after its driver namesake
(e.g. `ADC_t`). The user must define a configuration struct, which is fed into a
an initializer function, that pops out this struct type.

Some drivers may not have this resulting struct if the amount of useful
information required can be encapsulated into a single field, like `GPIOPin_t`.

The user can then use and modify this struct type to perform operations with it.
For example, a `PWM_t` struct can be passed into `PWMUpdateConfig()`, and the
the relevant internal registers and data structures will be modified
accordingly.

I have been following two rules when determining the composition and abstraction
of these drivers:

- The instance must only contains data. In the case of the ADC instance; perhaps
  only the ADC module value, the ADC sequencer value, and the interrupt handler
  pointer should be in it. Functions that act on the instance type should be
  divorced from the data. This allows the compiler to save ROM utilization by
  not linking functions never used by the instance. If the functions part sounds
  familiar, this is because this is functional programming. Otherwise this would
  be a C++ OOP object!
- All fields in the instance are public: The user retains the ability to peek
  inside the instance and see what is inside. By extension, the user can modify
  the instance without repercussions, unless explicitly noted. Therefore, it is
  necessary to abstract enough low level information such that the user can
  retain control over the object, but will not experience severe side effects
  when modifying it.


## Keil

A thorough guide on how to install and use it can be found on Valvano's
[site](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/EE445L/).

### Keil Bugfixing and Common Errors

- When trying to flash the program, you might get the error `No ULINK2/ME Device
  found`. Since we're using the Stellaris ICDI to flash, go to `Options for
  Target '[Project]'` -> `Debug` tab -> `Use: ULINK2/ME Cortex Debugger`. Scroll
  to `Stellaris ICDI` option and press OK. 
- When compiling the program, errors such as `Lab4.c(14): error:  #5: cannot
  open source input file "TM4C123Drivers/inc/tm4c123gh6pm.h": No such file or
  directory` may appear. Go to `Options for Target '[Project]'` -> `C/C++` tab
  -> `Include Paths` textbox. Include the parent directory path containing
  `TM4C123Drivers` (i.e., `..;..\..\..;C:\Users\matth\Documents\EE445L`). Press
  OK after the Compiler control string shows something like the following: `-I
  C:/Users/matth/Documents/EE445L`. 

## Manjaro

### Compiling with arm-none-eabi-gcc

1. Install the arm gcc toolchain crosscompiler:
   `sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc`
2. Install relevant libraries:
   `sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-newlib`
3. Check where the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` compiler is located:
   `pacman -Ql arm-none-eabi-gcc`
   - In my case, I get a long list with a specific set of binaries found in `/user/bin`

    ```bash
    ...
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-c++
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-cpp
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-g++
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc    # <<< THIS
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc-10.2.0
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc-ar
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc-nm
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc-ranlib
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcov
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcov-dump
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcov-tool
    arm-none-eabi-gcc /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-lto-dump
    ...
    ```

   - The specific compiler we're looking for, `arm-none-eabi-gcc` is found at `/usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc`. We call this command (or we can alias it in our `.bashrc`) every time we want to compile.
   - Also note we also have a couple other interesting tools that may come in
     handy; namely the c++ compiler, the code coverage tool gcov

4. Jump to the root of the repo and let's try an example compile.

   ```bash
   cd <PATH>/TM4C123Drivers
   /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc -c examples/Switch/SwitchExample.c -I..
   ```

   Note that the include flag and path `-I..` references the parent folder. This
   is in order to find the <TM4C123Drivers/**> component of the path.

   It should pass at this point an object file, `SwitchExample.o` should be
   found in the TM4C123Drivers folder.

### Flashing with OpenOCD

1. Install OpenOCD:
   `sudo pacman -S openocd`

2. Figure out where build files are:
   Typically, they'll be in a place like `/usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/`
   Since we're using the TM4C, our board is the `ti_ek-tm4c123gxl.cfg`.

3. Try to flash to the specific board.

## Other Linux Distributions

The steps should be pretty similar to Manjaro, but using `apt` or another
package manager rather than `pacman`.

## Static/Shared Library Generation

Drivers should potentially be obfuscated into a lib.

See [this source](https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/create-libraries/index) for figuring out how to hide implementation file details, in case this becomes an issue later.
